# ST Edge AI validation on target firmware

This firmware allows to perform the validation on target of neural network models converted with [ST Edge AI Core](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-core.html).

## Supported hardware and how to configure it

The firmware supports the combination of the following hardware:
 - Nucleo board: [Nucleo-F401RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html), [Nucleo-U575ZI-Q](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-u575zi-q.html)
 - Expansion board: [X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3](https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a3.html), [X-NUCLEO-IKS02A1](https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks02a1.html), [X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1](https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks4a1.html)
 - Sensor adapter board (only for X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 and X-NUCLEO-IKS02A1): [STEVAL-MKI229A](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mki229a.html), [STEVAL-MKI230KA](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mki230ka.html), [STEVAL-MKI233KA](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mki233ka.html)

In regards to the expansion board, make sure that the INT2 pin of the sensor is correctly routed, otherwise the measurement of the inference time of the model will not work:
 - On the X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3, JP6 (*USER_INT* routing selector) must be positioned to connect pins 13 and 14 to route *M_INT2_O*, the INT2 pin of the DIL24 adapter socket
 - On the X-NUCLEO-IKS02A1, JP6 (*USER_INT* routing selector) must be positioned to connect pins 5 and 6  to route *M_INT2_O*, the INT2 pin of the DIL24 adapter socket
 - On the X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1, the on-board LSM6DSO16IS sensor is used and the routing of the INT2 pin is not dependent on any jumper configuration

 Note: make sure that the Nucleo board ST-LINK firmware is updated to the latest version, as it may affect the correct functioning of the communication between the board and the PC. To check the ST-LINK firmware version and upgrade it, you may use the [dedicated upgrade utility](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html) or other ST tools that embed it (for example, [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) or [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)).

## Pre-built binaries, build and porting

The *binary* folder contains the pre-built firmware for the supported Nucleo boards. The board can be flashed by simply copying the binary file to the Nucleo board mass storage or by using [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html). Note that the firmware may be flashed only once (instead of every time a validation on target needs to be performed), as it automatically adapts to the model under validation.

The source project for each supported Nucleo board is also available in the dedicated folders. The projects can be built using either the Makefile (with the GNU Embedded Toolchain for ARM installed) or the [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) project. The projects can be generated for other development enviroments with [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) using the provided *.ioc* files.

The source code may also be used to port the firmware to a non-supported hardware setup. The firmware was generated using [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html). All custom code is contained in *Core/Inc/application.h* and *Core/Src/application.c* (the *application* function is called from *Core/Src/main.c* in the main loop), thus allowing for easy porting, without modifying much of *Core/Src/application.c*. Modifications might be necessary for code related to hardware dependent resources, such as timers, interrupt pins and communication interfaces.

## Validation template and validation flow

In order to perform the validation on target, a template to integrate the converted model and communicate with the Nucleo validation firmware is needed. The template for the specific sensors can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/ispu-examples) folder of this repository.

For more information on all the steps required to perform the validation on target, refer to the readme file of the validation template.
