# Contributing guide

This document serves as a checklist before contributing to this repository. It includes links to additional information if topics are unclear to you.

This guide mainly focuses on the proper use of GitHub.

## 1. Before opening an issue

Please check the following before posting an issue:
- Make sure you are using the latest commit.
- Make sure your issue is a question/feedback/suggestion **related to** the software provided in this repository. Otherwise, it should be discussed on the [ST Community forum](https://community.st.com/s/).
- Make sure your issue is not already reported/fixed on GitHub or discussed in a previous issue. Please refer to the "Issues" tab for the list of issues and pull-requests. Do not forget to browse to the **closed** issues.

## 2. Pull Requests

STMicroelectronics is happy to receive contributions from the community, based on an initial Contributor License Agreement (CLA) procedure:
* If you are an individual writing original source code and you are sure **you own the intellectual property**, then you need to sign an Individual CLA.
* If you work for a company that wants also to allow you to contribute with your work, your company needs to provide a Corporate CLA mentioning your GitHub account name.
* If you are not sure that a CLA (Individual or Corporate) has been signed for your GitHub account, you can check [here](https://cla.st.com).

Please note that:
* The Corporate CLA will always take precedence over the Individual CLA.
* One CLA submission is sufficient for any project proposed by STMicroelectronics.

### How to proceed

* We recommend to engage first a communication through an issue, in order to present your proposal and just to confirm that it corresponds to a STMicroelectronics domain or scope.
* Then fork the project to your GitHub account to further develop your contribution. Please use the latest commit version.
* Please submit a single Pull Request for one new feature or proposal. This will facilitate the analysis and the final merge, if accepted.
