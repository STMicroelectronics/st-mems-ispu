# Model zoo

The ISPU AI model zoo is a collection of machine learning models that are optimized to run on the ISPU and can be used as is or can be modified and retrained to fit the user needs.

Each model in the zoo features:
- Reference dataset
- Model pretrained on the reference dataset
- Pretrained model converted to code optimized for the ISPU, integrated into a complete ISPU project, and ready to test
- Scripts to easily retrain the model based on a user dataset and user configuration
- Automatic procedures to validate the retrained model on a PC and on the ISPU, and to regenerate the ISPU project for deployment
