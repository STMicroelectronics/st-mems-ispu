## 1 - Introduction

This is a template for validating on target (that is, on the ISPU) the code generated by [ST Edge AI Core](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-core.html), a tool that can be used to convert neural network models into implementations optimized for the ISPU.

Note that the current template supports ST Edge AI Core 2.0.0 and higher. For ST Edge AI Core 1.0.0 please refer to tag [stedgeai_core_1.0](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/st-mems-ispu/tree/stedgeai_core_1.0) of the GitHub repository.

The *ispu* folder of the template may be copied by itself (no dependencies other than the CLI toolchain or IDE environment that must be installed) and used to build the application running the model on the ISPU to perform the validation.


## 2 - Host board firmware

Validation on target with ST Edge AI Core requires flashing a specific firmware on the host board, which acts as a bridge between the user's PC and the ISPU. The firmware for the user's specific hardware setup can be found in the in the [host_firmware/nucleo_ispu_stedgeai_validate](../../../host_firmware/nucleo_ispu_stedgeai_validate) folder of this repository.

For information on the supported hardware and how to set it up, refer to the readme file of the firmware.

Note that the firmware may be flashed only once (instead of every time a validation on target needs to be performed), as it automatically adapts to the model under validation.

## 3 - Model implementation generation and build

The validation template project is structured so that ST Edge AI Core can automatically populate it with the necessary files in the right places. In order to achieve that, run the following command:

```shell
stedgeai generate --target ispu --no-workspace --no-report -m <nn_model_file> --output <ispu_folder>
```

where `nn_model_file` is the file containing the model of the neural network to convert and `ispu_folder` is a copy of the *ispu* folder of the template. Of course, additional options can be added to the `generate` command above as needed.

Alternatively, [MEMS Studio](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/mems-studio.html)'s ISPU Model Converter can be used to generate the network code, specifying `ispu_folder` as the output directory. [ST Edge AI Developer Cloud](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-dc.html) can also be used to generate and download the converted code.

The validation application can then be built just like any other ISPU project using the Makefile or the Eclipse project. Note that no modification to the project source files is required.


## 4 - Validation run

Once the validation application has been built, in order to perform the validation on target, run the following command:

```shell
stedgeai validate --target ispu -m <nn_model_file> --mode target --ucf <path_to_ucf>
```

where `nn_model_file` is the file containing the model of the neural network to validate and `path_to_ucf` is the path to the UCF just generated with the build of the validation application. If additional options to modify the converted model were specified in the `generate` command, they should be specified again here.

Note 1: By default, the UCF file is generated as *ispu/make/bin/ispu.ucf* if using the Makefile and as *ispu/eclipse/release/ispu.ucf* if using the Eclipse project.

Note 2: By default, the validation is performed with the ISPU clock configured at 5 MHz. To validate with the ISPU clock at 10 MHz, it is sufficient to modify the clock configuration in *ispu/conf.txt*.

Alternatively, [MEMS Studio](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/mems-studio.html)'s ISPU Model Converter can be used to perform the validation on target, specifying the path to the UCF. MEMS Studio can also be used to generate the UCF if the ISPU toolchain is installed and is set as an external tool in MEMS Studio's settings. [ST Edge AI Developer Cloud](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-dc.html) can instead be used to perform the validation on target without requiring any board connected to the user’s PC or the installation of any tool.
